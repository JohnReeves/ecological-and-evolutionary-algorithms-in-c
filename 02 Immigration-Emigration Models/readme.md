# immigration-emigration models

population change in an open system

### deterministic

##### discrete time model

N(t+dt) = N1 + a dt - b dt

##### continuous time model

N(t+dt) - Nt
----------- = a - b
    dt

lim dt -> 0 = dN / dt = a - b

### stochastic

assumes a small enough time step dt such that the transition dn = +/-1
